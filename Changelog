Changelog

 BiESAT --> Bi207 Energy Spectra Analysis Toolkit
==================================================

12.10.25
+ plotting the individual K, L, and M shell gaussians
  for the 976keV peak.

09.07.17
~ updated the 09.05.29 changes because the version on
  my laptop was more recent than the version on
  my pc at UCL.

09.07.07
~ officially now called BiESAT.cxx
~ tidy up the macro a bit

09.06.04
~ change first sigma aprox. to be 15% of adc position
~ change lower bounds on 976keV of the 1st fit

09.05.29
~ changed around many fitting parameters to fit lowres better
~ changed how calib is calculated from the gamma fit
+ add subtraction fit at the end of the program

09.05.26
+ root > 5.17 now works
~ changed the way calib is calculated for lowres and thick
~ changed around some fitting settings

09.05.22
+ delete func; to end of macro, seems to stop crashing
+ shifting the gamma hist to match beta at 500 compton
~ let exp0 free for first beta fit

08.11.03
+ use data2root.cxx to convert to rootfile
- NO MORE SUPPORT FOR RAW DATA FILES!!!

08.10.31
~ changed char[]'s to *char[]'s
~ fixed a bug when sped < s482 
+ combined in the rootfile method of reading data

08.10.22
~ changed the way the hists from rootfile are readin
~ changed offset calculatin to use 976-position and global calib
~ fixed the problem with scaling the histos!

08.09.30
+ tweaked parLimits for fitting gamma and multi-gamma
+ fixed the fit to account for multi scattering comptons
+ fixed parameters and if statements for thick and lowres options
~ changed gamma fit to use full fit

08.09.18
+ added condition to make sure compt1000 is less than gaus1000

08.09.09
+ added 'thick' option that deals with multi compton scattering
+ added in a section that normalizes the gamma spectra

08.09.08
- removed previous 'subtracted the Eloss contribution' NOT VALID
+ subtracted the Eloss contribution to sigma from measurement

08.09.05
- removed the gamma energy loss factor
