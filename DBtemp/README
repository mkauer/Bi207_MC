DBtemp
-----------------------
When you run 'data2root.cxx' the rootfile and config file etc
are placed in here. You must edit the config file to the correct
400keV compton edge position and 976keV CE peak position and
describe your setup conditions simular to the examples given in
the config file.

Then copy the files over to DBruns or DBsimu where BiESAT can 
find them and use them.
