Getting these old cern binaries and libs to work can be a pain on newer
x86_64 machines.

I managed to get everything working on SL6.3 x86_64 machine by installing
the following packages:

compat-gcc-34.x86_64
compat-gcc-34-c++.x86_64
compat-glibc.x86_64
binutils-devel.i686
glibc-devel.i686
libX11-devel.i686
compat-libf2c-34.i686
compat-libf2c-34.x86_64
compat-gcc-34-g77.x86_64
