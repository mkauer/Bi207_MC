DBsimu
-----------------------
Place your rootfiles and config files in here after you have modified
the config file for the correct compton edge positon and 976keV CE
peak position. 

This directory is for simulated data so that it is kept seperate from
the real data in DBruns.

BiESAT looks in DBruns by default so you must specify '1' as the 2nd
option when you run the macro:
in ROOT
> .x BiESAT.cxx ("runXXXX",1)
