 BiESAT --> Bi207 Energy Spectra Analysis Toolkit
==================================================

WARNING! this macro has been tested using ROOT versions
'5.14.00e' to '5.24.00' so there is a possibility of 
things breaking when using other versions of ROOT.

for example fitting do the following in ROOT:
root[0] .x BiESAT.cxx("run195")

assuming you have done a 'cvs checkout BiESAT' this
should work, ie the fit should go through all interations
and produce a final result of the fit.

the .conf file is of most importance to the user.
first create a rootfile from your pedistal, beta,
and gamma run data files, in ROOT:

root[0] .x data2root.cxx("ped-file","beta-file","gamma-file",chan)

chan --> either 1 or 9, 1 for lowres and 9 for hihes using VME
         with VME DAQ, lowres --> 0-7 and hires --> 8-15
         but chan 0 is damaged meaning chan 8 is also damaged

the generated files will be placed in ./DBtemp because the user
must first edit the .conf file and confirm the generated files
are correct. the user MUST edit the generated .conf file for the
correct 400keV compton edge position and 976keV CE peak position
in ADC bins (see exampls in ./DBruns). some other settings must
be adjusted to help BiESAT understand what it is trying to fit.

describe --> a string of information describing your setup
             this is useful for when other people want a quick
             overview of your setup and this way you don't have
             to go rumaging through your logbook.

pedrun   --> is the pedistal run file name
betarun  --> is the beta+gamma run file name
gammarun --> is the gamma run file name

gamma    --> is the 400keV compton edge position in ADC bins
beta     --> is the 976keV peak position in ADC bins
Eloss    --> is the estimated energy loss of the electrons
             through the air and reflective material

lowres   --> if the resolution is worse than ~8-9% set this
             to '1' because then BiESAT changes the fitting
             procedure a bit (too much to explain here).
thick    --> if your scint is thicker than ~5cm set this to
             '1' because BiESAT changes the fitting procedure
             a bit (too much to explain here).
fitopt   --> add any ROOT fitting options here you might want
             to test out (from TH1::Fit).
             http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TH1.html#TH1:Fit
rebin    --> sets the rebin for the histograms
maxbin   --> the maximum bin in your histograms (4000 if VME,
             2000 if CAMAC etc.)

once you have all the correct settins, copy over the files
into the ./DBruns directory. the files should include:
name.C, name.conf, name.png, name.root

then in ROOT do:

root[0] .x BiESAT("name")

and hopfully everything will work.


update
------------------
if you have files in the ./DBsimu folder, then do:
root[0] .x BiESAT("name",1)

and if you have files in the ./DBtemp folder, then do:
root[0] .x BiESAT("name",2)
